DATABASE stores the data.
ENTITY represents the data in Java.
REPOSITORY reads/writes the data.
SERVICE applies rules and logic.
CONTROLLER exposes endpoints to the outside world.
SWAGGER / TEST confirms everything is working.

(DATABASE → ENTITY → REPOSITORY → SERVICE → CONTROLLER → SWAGGER TEST)

It’s a small expression language 
built into Spring that allows you to 
dynamically evaluate expressions in annotations 
like @PreAuthorize or @PostAuthorize.
